# apns

Plugin to implement APNS push notifications on iOS and Firebase on Android. 

## Why this plugin was made?

Currently, the only available push notification plugin is `firebase_messaging`. This means that, even on iOS, you will need to setup firebase and communicate with Google to send push notification. This plugin solves the problem by providing native APNS implementation while leaving configured Firebase for Android.

## Usage
1. Configure firebase on Android according to instructions: https://pub.dartlang.org/packages/firebase_messaging.
2. On iOS, make sure you have correctly configured your app to support push notifications, and that you have generated certificate/token for sending pushes.
3. Add the following lines to the `didFinishLaunchingWithOptions` method in the AppDelegate.m/AppDelegate.swift file of your iOS project

Objective-C:
```objc
if (@available(iOS 10.0, *)) {
  [UNUserNotificationCenter currentNotificationCenter].delegate = (id<UNUserNotificationCenterDelegate>) self;
}
```

Swift:
```swift
if #available(iOS 10.0, *) {
  UNUserNotificationCenter.current().delegate = self as? UNUserNotificationCenterDelegate
}
```

4. Add `flutter_apns` as a [dependency in your pubspec.yaml file](https://flutter.io/platform-plugins/).
5. Using `createPushConnector()` method, configure push service according to your needs. `PushConnector` closely resembles `FirebaseMessaging`, so Firebase samples may be useful during implementation.
```dart
import 'package:flutter_apns/apns.dart';

final connector = createPushConnector();
connector.configure(
    onLaunch: _onLaunch,
    onResume: _onResume,
    onMessage: _onMessage,
);
connector.requestNotificationPermissions()
```
6. Build on device and test your solution using Firebase Console and NWPusher app.

## Additional APNS features:
### Displaying notification while in foreground

```dart
final connector = createPushConnector();
if (connector is ApnsPushConnector) {
  connector.shouldPresent = (x) => Future.value(true);
}
```

### Handling predefined actions

Firstly, configure supported actions:
```dart
final connector = createPushConnector();
if (connector is ApnsPushConnector) {
  connector.setNotificationCategories([
    UNNotificationCategory(
      identifier: 'MEETING_INVITATION',
      actions: [
        UNNotificationAction(
          identifier: 'ACCEPT_ACTION',
          title: 'Accept',
          options: [],
        ),
        UNNotificationAction(
          identifier: 'DECLINE_ACTION',
          title: 'Decline',
          options: [],
        ),
      ],
      intentIdentifiers: [],
      options: [],
    ),
  ]);
}
```

Then, handle possible actions in your push handler:
```dart
Future<dynamic> onPush(String name, Map<String, dynamic> payload) {
  storage.append('$name: $payload');

  final action = UNNotificationAction.getIdentifier(payload);

  if (action == 'MEETING_INVITATION') {
    // do something
  }

  return Future.value(true);
}
```

Note: if user clickes your notification while app is in the background, push will be delivered through onResume without actually waking up the app. Make sure your handling of given action is quick and error free, as execution time in for apps running in the background is very limited.

Check the example project for fully working code.

## Enabling FirebaseCore
If you want to use firebase, but not firebase messaging, add this configuration entry in your Info.plist:

```
<key>flutter_apns.disable_firebase_core</key>
<false/>
```



## Troubleshooting

1. Ensure that you are testing on actual device. NOTE: this may not be needed from 11.4: https://ohmyswift.com/blog/2020/02/13/simulating-remote-push-notifications-in-a-simulator/
2. If onToken method is not being called, add error logging to your AppDelegate, see code below.
3. Open Console app for macOS, connect your device, and run your app. Search for "PUSH registration failed" string in logs. The error message will tell you what was wrong.

*swift*
```swift
import UIKit
import Flutter

@UIApplicationMain
@objc class AppDelegate: FlutterAppDelegate {
  override func application(
    _ application: UIApplication,
    didFinishLaunchingWithOptions launchOptions: [UIApplication.LaunchOptionsKey: Any]?
  ) -> Bool {
    GeneratedPluginRegistrant.register(with: self)
    return super.application(application, didFinishLaunchingWithOptions: launchOptions)
  }

  func application(_ application: UIApplication, didFailToRegisterForRemoteNotificationsWithError error: Error) {
     NSLog("PUSH registration failed: \(error)")
  }
}

```

*objc*
```objc
#include "AppDelegate.h"
#include "GeneratedPluginRegistrant.h"

@implementation AppDelegate

- (BOOL)application:(UIApplication *)application
    didFinishLaunchingWithOptions:(NSDictionary *)launchOptions {
  [GeneratedPluginRegistrant registerWithRegistry:self];
  // Override point for customization after application launch.
  return [super application:application didFinishLaunchingWithOptions:launchOptions];
}

-(void)application:(UIApplication *)application didFailToRegisterForRemoteNotificationsWithError:(NSError *)error {
    NSLog(@"%@", error);
}

@end
```
